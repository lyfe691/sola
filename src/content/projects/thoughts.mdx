# Design Intent

**thoughts** was built to be a quieter companion to my main portfolio.  
It’s a space to write down reflections, fragments, and notes that don’t always fit into a polished project.  

The design emphasizes **clarity and simplicity**: minimal layout, careful typography, and enough whitespace for content to breathe. It’s meant to feel personal and unhurried — less like a portfolio, more like a notebook.

> “You were never supposed to be here.” — a subtle hint in the 404 page that sets the tone for this site.

## Technical Architecture

The site uses a **Next.js + MDX** stack for content flexibility and a lightweight publishing flow:

- **Next.js App Router** for structure and routing
- **MDX** for writing articles and reflections
- **Tailwind CSS** for design consistency
- **Custom fonts** locally hosted for performance
- **Vercel Postgres** for dynamic guestbook storage

<CodeBlock
  code={`// thoughts/[slug]/page.tsx
const { default: MDXContent, metadata } = await import(
  '../_articles/' + \`\${params.slug}.mdx\`
)

return (
  <div lang={metadata.chinese ? 'zh-Hans' : 'en'}>
    <MDXContent />
  </div>
)`}
  fileName="page.tsx"
  lang="typescript"
/>

## Features

- **MDX-powered publishing**  
  Each thought is a `.mdx` file with metadata (title, date, description). New posts are added by dropping files into the `_articles` folder.

- **Guestbook**  
  Inspired by older web traditions, I implemented a custom **guestbook feature** where visitors can leave their own notes.  
  It includes moderation (admin tokens) and works with Vercel Postgres, with a memory fallback for local development.

- **404 page as poetry**  
  Instead of a standard error, the *not-found* page doubles as a short verse, making even dead ends part of the site’s character.

## Inspiration

The project was directly inspired by [Shu Ding](https://shud.in)’s personal website — simple, text-first, and quietly expressive.  
I wanted a similar place for myself: less polished than my portfolio, more open-ended, and honest in tone.

---

## Results

This project gave me:

- A **personal writing space** separate from my portfolio
- A chance to explore **MDX workflows** in Next.js
- A custom feature (**guestbook**) that feels retro but modernized
- A flexible system I can expand with future notes and reflections

*thoughts isn’t a showcase site — it’s a personal corner of the web. A place to pause, write, and keep track of where my mind drifts.*
