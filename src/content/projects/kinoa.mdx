# Free Streaming Without the Noise

**Kinoa** is a free streaming website where you can watch films and series without subscriptions, paywalls, or ad clutter. It pulls live metadata from TMDB and delivers streams via third-party hosters with a clean, distraction-free interface. No popups, no waiting—just browse and play.

> "Press play. That's it."

## Design Philosophy

- Clean, minimal UI that puts content first
- Dark theme with warm accents for comfortable viewing
- Hero carousel, trending rows, and quick picks on the home page
- Inline playback on every detail page with automatic server failover
- No popups, no paywalls

## Technical Architecture

Kinoa is built on the **Next.js App Router** with React Server Components, keeping data fetching close to the UI while streaming responses to the client.

    "Next.js App Router",
    "React Server Components",
    "TypeScript",

    "shadcn/ui",
    "TMDB REST API",
    "Third-party Streaming",
    "Vercel",
  ]}
/>

### Route Structure

The core routes map directly to the streaming experience:

<CodeBlock
  code={`
├── page.tsx                 ← hero carousel, trending rows, quick picks
├── movie/[id]/page.tsx      ← detail view with inline trailer & recommendations
├── tv/[id]/[season]/[episode]/page.tsx
│   └── server selection + episodic playback
├── search/page.tsx          ← instant lookup across movies & series
└── (legal)/[slug]/page.tsx  ← privacy & terms in a dedicated slot

& a lot more...`}
fileName="app/"
lang="text"
/>

### How it looks

    {
      src: "/projects/kinoa/home.png",
      alt: "Kinoa home page - Light mode",
      caption: "Kinoa home page - Light mode",
    },
    {
      src: "/projects/kinoa/search.png",
      alt: "Kinoa search page - Light mode",
      caption: "Kinoa search page - Light mode",
    },
  ]}
  columns={2}
  size="full"
/>
### Data Layer

- Typed helper functions in `lib/tmdb.ts` wrap the TMDB REST API for fetching movie and series metadata.
- Responses are cached with `fetch` options tuned for the App Router to minimize redundant requests.
- Client pages stream metadata first, then load player embeds from third-party hosters, keeping interaction snappy.
- Server components handle data fetching server-side, reducing client bundle size and improving initial page loads.

## Feature Highlights

1. **Clean interface** — A minimal, clean UI that keeps the focus on content without distractions.
2. **Free streaming** — No subscriptions, no paywalls. Just browse and play.
3. **Inline playback everywhere** — Movie and series pages embed players directly from third-party hosters, so the play button never leaves the screen.
4. **Automatic server failover** — If one stream fails, the player automatically tries alternate servers without interruption.
5. **Episode navigator** — TV routes expose seasons, episodes, and alternate servers from one panel for quick access.
6. **Fast global search** — `/search` delivers instant feedback across films and shows as you type, with minimal UI chrome.
7. **Privacy-first stance** — No media is stored or proxied; playback stays on third-party domains and credentials remain out of the repo.

## Operations & Tooling

- Local development uses `pnpm` with strict linting and formatting scripts.
- Environment variables stay outside the repo (`NEXT_PUBLIC_TMDB_API_KEY`, `OMDB_API_KEY`).
- Deploying to **Vercel** unlocks edge caching, image optimisation, and automatic previews for every push.
